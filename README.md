# regex_tester
A simple command-line tool that allows you to test regular expressions against sample text. Enter a regex pattern and some test input, and the program will return all matches, their positions, and any helpful debug info. Great for experimenting, debugging, or gently torturing yourself with greedy vs. non-greedy patterns.
